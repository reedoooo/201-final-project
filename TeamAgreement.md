# 201-final-project
The final project in Code 201

## Authors: Reed Vogt, Jason Adams, Kawika Miller

## Cooperation Plan
- **What are the key strengths of each person on the team?** 
  - Reed: Able to put my nose to the grindstone when required and CSS enthusiast
  - Kawika: I’m a great problem solver & creative thinker and have a deep understanding of the concepts taught in 201
  - Jason: Team player, I can easily find ways to collaborate with the team.

- **How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?**
  - Kawika will be best suited to oversee the JS/functional side of the project, while Reed will be able to focus more on the CSS/design side of things. Jason will be able to contribute both efforts evenly and will be able to manage any content within the project. 

- **In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?**
  - Reed: I would like to improve on my integrity and leadership
  - Kawika: I want to improve on my results and and quality competencies.
  - Jason: I would like to improve on my Craft Competency, and Results Competency.

- **Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?**
  - Every day we’ll create a plan of action that covers progress and goals. We’ll also do daily check ins to see how each individual is doing on their specified task. 

## Conflict Plan

- **What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?**
  - We will try to identify the root cause of our conflict and then break it down piece by piece and attempt to resolve it - just like when we debug our code. While also practicing the psychological safety philosophy and treating each other with respect.

- **What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?**
  - Talk with the teammate who’s taking over and assert yourself as alpha by asking them to do another task for you. Just kidding, we will have to sit down and have a respectful conversation where we address our concerns about being excluded and how we can improve so that every member of the team has an equal role. 

- **How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?**
  - We’ll designate tasks based on skill level and each teammate can learn during the daily check ins what each person is doing. 

- **How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?**
  - Ask that team member if instead of doing their task they could help you with a task you’re actively doing. 

- **How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?**
  - When a person begins to blatantly refuse our partnership, the other teammates will plan an intervention to discuss with the person why they’re being a little punk bitch about it.

## Communication Plan

- **What hours will you be available to communicate?**
  - Hours of the day will be discussed at the beginning of the day (10:00am).

- **What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?**
  - We will use primarily use Slack to communicate

- **How often will you take breaks?**
  - During long coding sessions we will schedule a break every hour just as we do in class. 

- **What is your plan if you start to fall behind?**
  - If you fall behind the plan will be to talk to a teammate and have them catch you up. 

- **How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?**
  - We will continue to use Slack or send e-mails to one another

- **What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?**
  - To ensure everyone’s voice is heard we will do daily checkins where we can discuss concerns about the project
  
- **How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?**
  - By communicating frequently and evenly distributing the work load. 

## Work Plan:

- **Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.**
 
*NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.*

**Describe at least:**

- **How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?**
  - On the first day, we will create a wireframe/gameplan of everything we want to accomplish within our project and then break down that plan into smaller components and decide which pieces deserve more priority. Then we can decide who is most suited for those tasks and we can do check-ins with each other part-way through the day and then once more at the end. If everyone agrees that a given task is complete then the team member can move on to the next task.
 
- **What project management tool will be used?**
  - We will use Trello as our project management tool

## Schedule Your Practice Session:

Work with your instructor to pre-schedule an date and time for your “practice run” of your presentation. This should either be an exact time, or a short window of time designated by your instructor. Plan for a 30-45 minute meeting during the class session before your actual presentation to allow time for both your practice run and feedback from the instructional team.

Reminder as you work on and practice your presentations:

- Expressions of gratitude should be heartfelt.
- When not presenting, team members should make strong eye contact with the “audience” / camera.
- Be positive, no matter how tired or burned out you may feel … “Your smiles can be heard over the phone”

## Git Process

Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.

Describe at least:

- **What components of your project will live on GitHub?**
  - We will have a main branch which will be the deployed version of our project and a development branch which will be where we will create our own individual branches off of in order to create and test our features. 
  - 
- **How will you share the repository with your teammates?**
  - We will have one team member create the repository and then the other team members will be added as collaborators and they will be able to clone the repo to their machines.
  - 
- **What is your Git flow?**
  - We will each work on our own branches every day and then periodically make ACPs to our working branches, and then when we need to we will create PRs, merge them to the development branch, and then each do a `git pull` so that our local files are up to date with all the changes that have been made.

- **Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:**
  - *How many people must review a PR?* 
    - Each team member will need to review and approve of the PR before we decide to merge.
  - *Who merges PRs?* 
    - Reed will oversee the merging of PRs
  - *How often will you merge?* 
    - At the very least, we will merge our working branches to the development branch if the tasks have been successfully completed otherwise we will put that off until later.
  - *How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?* 
    - If everyone’s tasks have been completed successfully &/o if the other team members need those files in order to move forward then we will merge our branches.
