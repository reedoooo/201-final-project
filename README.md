## User Stories

### Software Developer:
As a software developer, I want to be able to easily access the web app to manage finished projects as well as current client projects, so I can stay on top of deadlines and ensure my work is delivered on time. I should be able to easily create new folders, assign them to clients, keep notes, and track progress. 

### Software Developer Student:
As a software developer student, I want to be able to easily access the web app to manage and showcase my projects. The interface should be user-friendly and intuitive, so I can quickly access the features I need and manage my lab projects efficiently. I should also be able to view a dashboard of my current projects. I’d like to also be able to save my coding resources for quick reference. 

### Uni Comp Sci Student:
As a student, I want to be able to easily access the web app to manage tasks and track progress, and projects. The tool should be easy to use, so I can easily manage my tasks efficiently. I should be able to easily create folders for past, current, and future projects. Finally, it would be great if I was able to change the style or color patterns. 

### Average Joe
As a user I want the app to be easy to use and allow me to do most of my daily project tracking tasks all within one app.

### Self-Taught Software Developer:
As a self-taught software developer, I’d like the app to have my projects available on one page and be able to click on a project and view the code and live view at the same time within the page. 

## Portfolio Project
Our goal is to create an all-in-one portfolio presentation app for software developers &/o any tech industry roles. We wanted to create an app that could host all of a developers projects and also display them side by side so that you can see what was created and how it was made. We also want to give the user the ability to create and store notes so that they can refer to them at any given time and have it all located in one convenient location. Additionally, our goals with this app include giving the user personalization options such as adjusting the color schemes, adding folder images, and the ability to add favorited projects.
