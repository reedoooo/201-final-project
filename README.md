## Portfolio Project
Our goal is to create an all-in-one portfolio presentation app for software developers &/o any tech industry roles. We wanted to create an app that could host all of a developers projects and also display them side by side so that you can see what was created and how it was made. We also want to give the user the ability to create and store notes so that they can refer to them at any given time and have it all located in one convenient location. Additionally, the app also gives the user personalization options such as adjusting the color schemes, adding folder images, and the abiility to add favorited projects.
